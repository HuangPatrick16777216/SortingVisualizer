# SortingVisualizer
### by Patrick Huang

This Python program allows you to visualize different sorting algorithms. You can see how they work, as well as their complexity.
Algorithms included:
* Insertion
* Cocktail
* Selection
* Bubble
* Pigeonhole
* Shell
* Gnome

How to use:
1. Adjust the _Set Size_ slider to the desired size. This controls how many elements there are.
2. Click _Generate Set_ to create a new set of elements.
3. Click one of the algorithms, and watch the sorting!

Additional features:
* Click _Stop_ to stop the algorithm at any time.
* Click _Sort_ to immediately sort the current elements.
